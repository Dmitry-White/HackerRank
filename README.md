A place to store all my progress on HackerRank Tracks. </br>
And all solutions from tons of competitions - for refactoring purpose, of course :|


## Description

There're lots of tracks to follow and I'm aiming to solve them all.
So I place them here to have a quick access and refactor from time to time.
And also - HackerRank competitions, which are usually high-server-load situations and it's more convenient to write/test code locally and then store solutions on GitHub.
Besides, sometimes I feel an irresistible urge to go back and rewrite that piece of code that bugged me.
